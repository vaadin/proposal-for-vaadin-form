# proposal-for-lit-form
A TS library for form binding and validation for lit-html

## Status
We are validating the idea, there is no implementation yet.
Your feedback is welcome! Please [create issues](https://github.com/vaadin/proposal-for-lit-form/issues/new) in this repo.

## Overview and motivation
_When people look at this page, I (as a Vaadin developer) want that the target audience and the problem in scope are clear, so that the people for whom it's relevant will want to read it and comment on it._

## Code samples
_I want this page to give specific examples in TS / HTML so that the discussion can be specific, and cented around a shared context._

In scope
 - simple example (binding, no validation)
 - field-level valiation
 - form-level validation
 - async validation

## Out of scope
To be added later.

_I want this page to clearly state which use cases are out of scope so that they can be easily excluded from any discussions, and the dscussion can stay fosued on the featues in scope._
